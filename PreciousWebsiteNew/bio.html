                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em>Precious Leona Guevarra Lansigan</em></strong>, born on <strong>August 25, 2004</strong>, in Lying in, 
                    Marulas, Valenzuela City.<sup>1</sup> She grew up in a family of five; her father, <em>Rolando R. Lansigan</em>, 
                      her mother,<em> Raquel G. Lansigan</em>, her older brother, Paolo Luis G. Lansigan, and her older 
                  sister, Patricia Lorraine G. Lansigan.<sup>2</sup> She lived in a neighborhood surrounded by her  
                  relatives.<sup>3</sup> She was an extroverted child, as her parents often tell, and she wasn’t shy 
                  about showing off her talents.<sup>4</sup> She was encourage to dance in 
                        public or <quote>"rumampa”</quote>, and she would do it, even if it meant being the center of attention.<sup>5</sup> 
                  One of her earliest memories is trying to read a book in English, though she didn’t know 
                        how to read yet.<sup>6</sup> She was babbling the word <b>“heart”</b>, and even though she didn’t 
                  understand it, she felt proud to try.<sup>7</sup> Apparently, there’s a video of her doing this on the 
                  internet, which is both funny and nostalgic to look back on.<sup>8</sup> As a child, she had a passion 
                        for <em>drawing</em>.<sup>9</sup> She spent hours copying drawings she found online, trying to perfect them and 
                  proudly showing them to her parents.<sup>10</sup> They always encouraged her, and she felt a strong 
                        <strong>sense of accomplishment</strong> when they praised her work.<sup>11</sup> This early experience might have 
                  sparked her desire for validation, a trait she's still working on today.<sup>12</sup> Her childhood wasn’t 
                        just about drawing or performing for her family, it was also about <em>friendships</em>.<sup>13</sup> She have 2 
                        childhood bestfriends, <em>Adrian</em>, who is a relative of her, and <em>Lara</em>, a friend that lived 
                  nearby them.<sup>14</sup> They did everything together, from playing outside to having a sleepover at 
                  her house.<sup>15</sup> Till to this day, their friendship is still strong as ever!<sup>16</sup> She studied in <b>St. Mary’s 
                        Academy of Caloocan City</b> where she also made friends, some of whom she's still close with 
                  today.<sup>17</sup> The bond they formed in those early years has endured, and they still keep in touch 
                  regularly.<sup>18</sup> Her friends and her shared everything, from their favorite games to their personal 
                  dreams, and they still connect to this day.<sup>19</sup> She had a great time in her childhood, and those 
                  were truly some of the most fun and meaningful years of her life.<sup>20</sup> Looking back, she's
                  grateful for the relationships she built during that time.<sup>21</sup></p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her transition to high school was not that tough, at least in terms of 
                    changing schools.<sup>1</sup> She simply moved from heer old school to the one beside it, <b>Notre Dame 
                      of Greater Manila</b>, along with her elementary school friends.<sup>2</sup> She actually just followed her 
                    sister who was already a student there, and her friends followed her as well.<sup>3</sup> It was 
                    exciting because it felt like a fresh start in a new environment, even though she was 
                    familiar with the place.<sup>4</sup> The school was much bigger, with a lot more students, which 
                      made it feel like a whole new world to explore.<sup>5</sup> <em>She performed academically well</em> in that 
                      school, and even made it to the <strong>top 40 </strong>students in their batch, which really boosted her
                    confidence.<sup>6</sup> However, there were some challenges she faced academically that she still deals
                    with today.<sup>7</sup> One of the biggest challenges was that she never really learned how to study 
                    effectively.<sup>8</sup> She mostly relied on answering questions in exams and hoping she got them 
                    right, and surprisingly, this strategy worked out well until now.<sup>9</sup> She managed to remain 
                      a <em>consistent honor student</em> all throughout high school, up until senior high.<sup>10</sup> In grade 9, she was chosen, along with others, to join a competition on General Computer Subjects, 
                      and <strong>they won first place!</strong><sup>11</sup> It was an incredible experience, though the pressure of making 
                    quick decisions under time constraints was nerve-wracking, which is why she decided not 
                    to join any more competitions after that.<sup>12</sup> Then, the pandemic hit, and everything 
                    changed.<sup>13</sup> She was stuck at home for two years, and school became even more 
                    challenging.<sup>14</sup> Despite the tough situation, Precious surprisingly thrived during that time.<sup>15</sup> She was 
                    much more active and engaged compared to previous school years.<sup>16</sup> In grade 11, Precious was 
                    elected vice governor of the class, and in grade 12, she joined the student council.<sup>17</sup> Being 
                    part of the student council benefited her socially and helped her develop leadership 
                    skills.<sup>18</sup> It pushed her to interact with students from different year levels, which was 
                    something Precious had never done before.<sup>19</sup> It also gave her a sense of responsibility and 
                    ownership over her school, and she felt like she truly belonged to the community.<sup>20</sup> The last 
                    achievement Precious earned during high school and senior high school years was receiving 
                      the <strong>Best Research Award in ICT</strong>.<sup>21</sup> Winning that award not only validated her hard work 
                    but also gave her a sense of accomplishment that she carried into college years with her
                    newfound confidence.<sup>22</sup> <em>The pandemic and her involvement in school leadership gave Precious
                      a new perspective on what it meant to be part of something bigger than herself.</em><sup>23</sup></p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is currently pursuing a <em>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology</em> at the 
                    <strong>University of the East - Manila</strong>.<sup>1</sup> It has been a thrilling experience for her, to say the least.<sup>2</sup> The 
               university is located far from where she lives, and the culture there is very different from 
                    what she is used to.<sup>3</sup> Initially, <em>Precious considered other universities </em>like <b>Ateneo and <a title"Delasalle University">DLSU</a></b> since she 
               passed their entrance exams, but the scholarships offered by UE were too tempting to 
               ignore.<sup>4</sup> Precious believed in herself and knew she could earn those scholarships, which, luckily, she
               did.<sup>5</sup> She wasn’t nervous about starting at UE because her sister also graduated from there, 
               so she had some guidance about how to navigate the campus.<sup>6</sup> However, she did feel nervous 
               about interacting with other students.<sup>7</sup> Since no one from her old school attends UE, she
               had to rely on her social skills to make new friends.<sup>8</sup> Fortunately, Precious managed to form a 
               group of friends who trust and support each other.<sup>9</sup> Academically, she's doing well, not 
               necessarily excelling, but definitely not falling behind either.<sup>10</sup> She also joined an organization 
                    called <strong>Research and Development</strong>, where she's part of the research team.<sup>11</sup> This 
               organization has been a huge help to her, especially as the workload gets more intense.<sup>12</sup> 
               However, she's quite nervous about next school year when they start working on their
               thesis.<sup>13</sup> The pressure is building, and Precious is worried she won’t be able to deliver the way she
               intend to.<sup>14</sup> Despite this, she's determined to push through and overcome her fears by 
               becoming the best version of herself.<sup>15</sup> Precious plan to stay focused and maintain a positive 
               state of mind as she tackles the challenges ahead.<sup>16</sup> For her future,Precious is not going to lock herself in a single path, rather, she's going to open multiple doors for her to take, for her
               to explore, so that her future will be as bright as God intended it to be.<sup>17</sup> <em>She know that she has
                  been through a lot, but somehow, Precious always made it through</em>.<sup>18</sup> Just like before, when she
               faced challenges and thought she wouldn’t make it, Precious always found a way.<sup>19</sup> She remind myself 
               that, no matter what comes next, she have the strength to handle it.<sup>20</sup> She know it’ll be okay, 
               like it always has been.<sup>21</sup> <em><strong>As she continue this life, she'll take things one step at a time, 
                    confident that, in the end, everything will fall into place.</strong> </em><sup>22</sup></p>
