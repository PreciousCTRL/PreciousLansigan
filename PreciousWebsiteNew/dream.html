            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you asked me a 10 years ago what my dream location would be, I would probably say Japan or Korea, however, I've been there already so I've got to look for another place
                to go to. Recently, I've been interested on going to Europe. I've watched the Eurovision 2024 and was intrigued on the culture of each country that performed, specifically The Netherlands. 
                Ever since I got hooked into the performer for The Netherlands, I keep on looking about the country. I really wanted to visit Amsterdam. For Germany, I wanted to go there to see the location 
                of the set of the series Dark on Netflix. I also wanted to see how good their country is. For England, there's no particular reason why I wanted to go there. Just for the experience, I guess.
